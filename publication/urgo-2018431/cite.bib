 abstract = {Aircraft manufacturers are challenged with increasing demand requiring customers to place orders months in advance respect to the time aircrafts will be operative. Consequently, customers decide aircraft's size but have additional time to select cabin fittings. Nevertheless, manufacturers must promise a delivery time, regardless real aircraft configuration and resource availability at the production sites. We propose a novel framework for order allocation and sequencing in aircraft manufacturing minimizing the risk for manufacturing costs. Different degrees of uncertainty affecting products, work content and resources are considered as time advances and decisions to be taken change. An industrial application is also presented.
