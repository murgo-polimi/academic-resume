 abstract = {This paper proposes a model-driven interoperability framework as a technical support of co-evolution strategy of product structure and production systems with a frugal innovation perspective. Based on the modularity concept, the role of this framework is to connect possible product modules managed in the Product Life cycle Management tool to all possible production capabilities managed on the Manufacturing Process Management tool, and able to realize each module. This will help designers to define the optimal product architecture based on technical features of modules regarding the functional requirements as well as the optimal production strategy.
