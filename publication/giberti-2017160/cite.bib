 abstract = {In the operation of a broad range of industrial processes, the uses of robots whose trajectories are constrained by the velocity of the parts actuated (tools, end effectors, joints and the like) more often than not play a significant role. Keeping our focus on systems for material deposition such as painting, glueing, aerosol spraying but nowadays also additive manufacturing techniques like FDM processes, it is noticeable that a key parameter is the control of the flow of material in accordance with the trajectory velocity of the parts being actuated. According to the specific requirements and goals of different technology, it is possible to generate different trajectories. In this paper, we propose an original path planning algorithm based on the use of Bézier curves aimed at assuring regulation of the velocity and a uniform distribution of the extruded material referring to an innovative additive manufacturing technology. In particular, the paper presents a path planning technology developed for an application where it is necessary to maintain a constant velocity along the length of the trajectory aimed at improving the technological processes on the basis of an innovative additive technology. The paper further presents a working application with a machine prototype so as to demonstrate the viability and performance of the work under consideration. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},
