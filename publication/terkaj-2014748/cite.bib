 abstract = {This paper presents the extension to an ontology-based data model supporting the design and performance evaluation of production systems. This extension aims to link the modeling of the spatial representation of physical objects with the characterization of their states and behavior. Furthermore, the formalization of the performance history of a production system and its components is addressed to capture both the spatial and state evolution of the objects. Such history can be provided by simulation runs or gathered from a monitoring system. A test case is described and then used to show how different software tools can be integrated to support the integrated design and evaluation of a production system. Â© 2014 IEEE.},
