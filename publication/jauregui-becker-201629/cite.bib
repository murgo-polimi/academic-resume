 abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the research goals and current research status of the EU-FP7 project RobustPlaNet. A description of the general concept and vision of the project is presented and the adopted definition of robustness at plant and supply chain levels are discussed. Moreover, the RobustPlaNet approach and its innovative technologies and methods are described, followed by a summary of the different industrial use cases. The architecture of the decision support cockpit that will emerge from the integration of these tools is presented. At last, the overall impact of the RobustPlaNet solution is discussed, supporting the European manufacturing industry in the transition towards shock-robust plants and supply chains Â© 2016},
