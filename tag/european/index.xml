In particular, to conduct advanced field trials of the more representative and innovative data-driven material, production and installation flows that implicate manufacturing across 4 prominent industries in the wood sector including, machinery and wood house elements manufacturing, construction and renovation towards green buildings, wood waste valorisation, and established telecom SME industries in a project remit that spans 3 representative European regions (Norway, Estonia, Finland). The project incentivises the opportunistic uptake of 5G in real-life business conditions. Specifically, 5G- TIMBER will target to increase wood-based materials recycling by 50%, increase manufacturing productivity by 15%, reach 99% of the work done in the factory (vs. 85% today), reduce on-site work by 10%, reduce product nonconformities by 10%, and increase the safety of workers in wooden houses production and onsite assembling. Validation of above overall targets through &amp;gt;100 interdisciplinary innovation driven technical, business and service-level KPIs for 09 diverse WVC usecases across 3 categories i.e., data driven sawmill woodworking machines; modular wood-house factory; construction and renovation with wooden elements, valorisation of composite waste. Usecases will be incrementally validated by 2 lab trials followed by 2 field trials in iterative cycle covering significant portions of end-to-end WVC. 5G-TIMBER also includes a comprehensive business case and exploitation strategy that incorporates novel approaches to materializing the value of data produced in industrial environments based upon 4 distinct business models. Our 16-partner consortium is driven by strong industrial and SME partners, renowned organisations the majority of which participate in FoF cPPP, 5G-PPP, GD projects.&lt;/p>

Intelligent plug-and-produce devices are being developed, able to self-describing mechatronic objects, auto-program and self-adjust to the required task by utilizing parametric capabilities. These next generation flexible production systems and the proposed set of enabling ICT tools will allow a rapid and cost-efficient reaction to dynamic market changes, also in small-lot production contexts, reducing the efforts needed to switch between product types and production quantities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Role:&lt;/strong> Scientific responsible for Task 4.7: Integrated reconfiguration and production planning tool, to develop a software tool for supporting the integrated production and reconfiguration decision making. These tools are going to be applied to the Bosch and Cosberg use cases.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
