In particular, to conduct advanced field trials of the more representative and innovative data-driven material, production and installation flows that implicate manufacturing across 4 prominent industries in the wood sector including, machinery and wood house elements manufacturing, construction and renovation towards green buildings, wood waste valorisation, and established telecom SME industries in a project remit that spans 3 representative European regions (Norway, Estonia, Finland). The project incentivises the opportunistic uptake of 5G in real-life business conditions. Specifically, 5G- TIMBER will target to increase wood-based materials recycling by 50%, increase manufacturing productivity by 15%, reach 99% of the work done in the factory (vs. 85% today), reduce on-site work by 10%, reduce product nonconformities by 10%, and increase the safety of workers in wooden houses production and onsite assembling. Validation of above overall targets through \u0026gt;100 interdisciplinary innovation driven technical, business and service-level KPIs for 09 diverse WVC usecases across 3 categories i.e., data driven sawmill woodworking machines; modular wood-house factory; construction and renovation with wooden elements, valorisation of composite waste. Usecases will be incrementally validated by 2 lab trials followed by 2 field trials in iterative cycle covering significant portions of end-to-end WVC. 5G-TIMBER also includes a comprehensive business case and exploitation strategy that incorporates novel approaches to materializing the value of data produced in industrial environments based upon 4 distinct business models.

Indeed, there is still a lack of reference integrated workflows to perform the wide span of tasks, ranging from layout configuration and performance evaluations to 3D representations. Commercial software tools are either too complex or expensive to be approached by non-specialists, therefore it is hard to design effective learning activities in manufacturing system engineering. This paper proposes a structured learning workflow based on an open toolkit that takes advantage of a common ontology-based data model to smoothly integrate digital tools for manufacturing system modelling, performance evaluation, and virtual reality representation.

This paper proposes a general approach for using phase-type distributions to model the execution of a network of activities with generally distributed durations through a Markov chain. An analytical representation of the infinitesimal generator of the Markov chain in terms of Kronecker algebra is proposed, providing a general formulation for this class of problems and supporting more efficient computation methods. This entails the capability to address stochastic scheduling in terms of the estimation of the distribution of common objective functions (i.e., makespan, lateness), enabling the use of risk measures to address robustness.

Nevertheless, the protection of the schedule from rare events causing heavy losses is still a challenging aim. The paper presents a novel approach for protecting the quality of a schedule by assessing the risk associated to the different scheduling decisions. The approach is applied to a stochastic scheduling problem with a set of jobs to be sequenced on a single machine. The release dates and processing times of the jobs are generally distributed independent random variables, while the due dates are deterministic. A branch-and-bound approach is taken to minimise the value-at-risk of the distribution of the maximum lateness.

These trends affect many industrial sectors, including the automotive one, impacting the whole supply chain, including the production of spare parts. The automotive spare part’s market is aimed at providing replacing parts during the whole life cycle of cars. As the design of cars becomes more and more sophisticated, producing spare parts requires complex production processes, a wide range of different technologies and the need to cope with different materials. In this context, the design of assembly systems and proper management policies have a considerable importance for the competitiveness of spare parts suppliers. In this paper, a configuration approach is proposed, to select a robust design solution for a reconfigurable assembly cell. The solution consists of an initial configuration together with a set of alternative reconfiguration plans to cope with the intrinsic uncertainty of the spare part manufacturing requirements. An innovative reconfigurable assembly cell architecture is exploited, while robustness is pursued by minimising a function of the risk associated with investment and operational costs of the assembly cell.

This is a highly complex planning task, as requirements of procurement, production, distribution, and sales have to be considered. Providing customers with the flexibility of configuring their ordered products after order assignment further increases the complexity of the planning task by taking uncertainty into account. Therefore, a robust optimisation model, using scenarios representing potential customer-specific order configurations, is introduced. By providing enough flexibility to handle maximum work overload caused by the potential order configurations at locations, a robust assignment of orders can be guaranteed in order to avoid undesirable situations causing delays and additional costs. Therefore, the mid-term adjustments of the flexibility limits are enabled by the changeability of workforce supply by making use of external workers. An industrial application of the model in manufacturing of the Airbus A320 Family of aircrafts is presented. The costs for offering configuration flexibility to customers are quantified by the expected value of perfect information. The explicit consideration of configuration uncertainty through the use of scenarios is discussed based on the value of the stochastic solution in comparison to the results attained by simplistically using the expected value. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

In this context, a Make To Order (MTO) and Engineer To Order (ETO) paradigms are viable approaches. Using these paradigms, the coordination between supplying and manufacturing has a prominent importance. A missing component during the production phase can cause significant delays and disruptions in the plans and, consequently, delays respect to the due dates negotiated with the customers. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty associated to the selection of customization options by the user, the supplying of the components and the production/assembly process, company managers addressing this coordination problem have to ground on risk measures supporting the selection of the right supplying option, aiming at minimizing the probability of missing components. In this paper, we present an approach to support this selection in the production and assembling of complex products grounding on the definition and calculation of two indicators, the Risk Index and the Criticality Index. The first one addressing the risk associated to the supplying of a component through different supplying alternatives, the second one providing an assessment of the criticality of the coordination between the supplying and assembling phases together with the specific risk aversion.

Hence, the constraints for their flexibility are shifted from the machines to the pallets. An interesting trend in the fixture market are zero-point fixture systems grounding on a clamping system that can hold standard baseplates where the fixture has been previously mounted. This allows a rapid and safe exchange of the baseplates without the need of realignment between the modular fixture and the pallet. In this paper we present an approach for rapid pallet configuration that exploits the additional level of flexibility provided by zero-point fixture systems. Grounding on an ontology-based data model, the description of the production process as a Network Part Program is used to evaluate the impact of rapid pallet configuration at system level and also how these degrees of freedom can be used in the management of the system.

Co-evolution of product and production systems is required to reach frugality goals. The success of the co-evolution strategy should be based on robust models ensuring the global consistency of the whole development process. Modular-based models are a good solution for such problematics since they provide a common semantic for the representation of the physical product structure as well as the organizational structure of the production system through the definition of interfaces between elements and the hierarchical decomposition of a system into different elements. This paper proposes a conceptual modular-based approach dealing with the selection of product modules influencing the selection of suppliers and the allocation of orders in a global production network. The indirect linking of the customer to production is also discussed in terms of the timewise restrictions in selecting product modules offering the customer a maximum degree of flexibility in product specification. © 2016 The Authors.","tags":[],"title":"Co-Definition of Product Structure and Production Network for Frugal Innovation Perspectives: Towards a Modular-based Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The proposed approach deals with the estimation of the duration of a production process modeled through a project network whose activities have an uncertain duration. It can provide support to a manager in the estimation of the makespan of the production of a product to provide a realistic and competitive due date to the customer, as well as to manage the scheduling of production and supplying operations and the resources assignment within the plant.

The main reason is that aggregate production operations correspond to whole production phases, thus requiring planning, scheduling, and procurement activities to be considered at the same decision level. This makes project scheduling approaches particularly suitable for this context. However, the pervasive use of human resources (most operations are executed manually) poses other problems related to the definition of activity durations. In fact, the duration of an activity cannot be a priori defined because it is related to the amount of allotted resources, which in turn depends on the number of products processed at the same time in the shop floor and on the number of workers involved, which can also vary over time. This impacts also on the possibility of correctly modelling the precedence relations between aggregate activities. In this chapter we propose a way to tackle such problems, using a project scheduling approach with a variable intensity formulation and feeding precedence relations and show its application to a real industrial case. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","tags":[],"title":"Project scheduling for aggregate production scheduling in make-to-order environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic programming project scheduling approach to support production planning in ETO/MTO system. The approach provides a baseline production plan together with a set of revisions of the plan to react to the occurrence of uncertain events.

Project scheduling approaches are suitable for production planning in such environments. However, when we consider the production of complex items, the distinct production operations are often aggregated into activities representing whole production phases. In such cases, the planning and scheduling problem works on the aggregate activities, considering that, in most cases, such activities also have to be manually executed. Moreover, simple finish-to-start precedence relations no longer correctly represent the real production process, but overlapping among activities should be allowed. In this paper, a project scheduling approach is proposed for production planning in Manufacturing-to-Order systems. The Variable Intensity formulation is used to allow the effort committed to the execution of activities to vary over time. Feeding precedences are developed to model generalised precedence relations when the execution mode of activities is not known a priori. Two mathematical formulations of these precedence relations are proposed. The formulations are applied both to randomly generated instances and to an industrial system producing machining centres and are compared in terms of computational efficiency. © 2011 Taylor \u0026 Francis.","tags":[],"title":"A project scheduling approach to production planning with feeding precedence relations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.
